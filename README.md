# SLOT-MACHINE-GAME
A Python slot machine game is a simple text-based casino simulation where players spin reels to match symbols. Using randomization and loops, the game mimics real slot mechanics. Players bet, spin, and either win or lose coins based on symbol matches, making it a fun way to practice Python logic and functions.
